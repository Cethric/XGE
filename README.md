I do not know where I am going with this project as of yet but I hope something great can come of it.
For those who wish to run it, compile the code, and run ./src/com/cethric/xge/editor/Editor.class for an example on how to use the engine.
If you are using InteliJ Idea select the appropriate platform "Editor" (for OSX) or "Editor Windows" (for Windows)


This is a experimental game engine and should not be used for major projects.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
