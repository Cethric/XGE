This is a complete rewrite of the code paying attention to the suggestions
and improvements by cclauss

### Features to include

done by ~~ACE~~ CodeMirror

+ [ ] Dropbox, Onedrive, GoogleDrive, FPT and other cloud based file
management services to be incoorperated.
+ [x] Ability to save to zipfile

intergrated HTTP server).

+ [ ] Code clean up
+ [ ] Work on the server side (Thank you [Gerzer](https://github.com/Gerzer))
+ [ ] Make the editor a litle but more reliable

### HTML Editor Features
+ ~~HTML tag completions~~ CodeMirror might not do this...
+ HTML quick previewer
+ ~~HTML code checking~~ CodeMirror might not do this...
+ Syntax Highlighter - Done Through ~~ACE~~ CodeMirror

### KNOWN BUGS
+ ~~Opening a file usually doesn't work, the file gets overwritten before display causing major issues (issue #12)~~
+ ~~The close button sometimes hangs requiring an app restart (issue #13)~~
+ ~~Opening a file disables the ui.Webview (issue [#18](https://github.com/Cethric/HTMLEditor-Pythonista/issues/18))~~
+ Adding a tag through the tag insert system may overwrite all of the open files (issue [#24](https://github.com/Cethric/HTMLEditor-Pythonista/issues/24))
